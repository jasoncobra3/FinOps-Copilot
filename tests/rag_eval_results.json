    "expected_answer": "Review dev resources for optimization opportunities like shutting down outside business hours and right-sizing instances.",
    "system_answer": "To reduce costs in the development environment, consider the following:\n\n1. **Terminate or stop idle resources**: Check for resources idle >30 days. Since res-30 was idle in 2025-04, we need to terminate or stop it to avoid potential costs. Estimate savings by current monthly cost \u00d7 0.7. However, current usage in subsequent months indicates potential for cost reduction in 2025-09 (43.65).\n\n2. **Right-size compute**: Review your instance families to ensure they have lower unit costs. If possible, scale vertically only when necessary to avoid unnecessary costs.\n\n3. **Verify tags**: Ensure every resource has the required tags, especially in the development environment. In this case, res-1 and res-30 have 'owner' and 'env' tags, but we should verify if 'project' tags are correctly assigned.\n\n4. **Monitor unit cost changes**: Verify sudden unit cost changes and ensure billing currency/units are correct to prevent unexpected costs.\n\n5. **Group small resources**: Consider grouping small resources into aggregated budgets to avoid per-resource billing noise in the development environment.\n\n**Problem:** 'unassigned' ownership for resources res-1 and res-30 [finops_2]. This creates unknown/unattributed spend and prevents cost accountability. Proper tagging is essential for accurate cost attribution and cost optimization.\n\n**Cost Impact:** Estimated savings by terminating or stopping idle resources (res-30) would be based on its current monthly cost, which is not explicitly provided. However, in 2025-05, it cost 30.65. To estimate savings, calculate current monthly cost (assuming constant usage) and apply the 0.7 factor.",
